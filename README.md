## Background
The Israeli spacecraft "Beresheet", launched by SpaceIL and Israel Aerospace Industries, was intended to be the first private spacecraft to land on the Moon.   
On April 11, 2019, during the final landing phase, a technical malfunction occurred, leading to a loss of control and a crash on the lunar surface.

## Q1
- **Star tracker malfunction on launch night**: A pair of cameras designed to determine the spacecraft's angle in space were apparently blinded by dust particles that landed on their shields as it separated from the launch vehicle. The team had to find creative solutions to get around this problem - including tilting the spacecraft on its side during maneuvers, and **using accelerometers** instead of the star trackers.

## Visual Data and Graphs
To see the visual data and graphs.  
Go to the **python** folder  
Using Python is a great way to read a CSV and plot data like altitude, speed, or fuel !

- **CSV-TO-PLOT.py** - Displaying the data graphically
- **simulate.py** - Running the simulation in a 3D experimental model

- **NOTE** - You can see the The other data like ACC in another graph by changing in the field *CSV-TO-PLOT.py* one of the columns in the file to the data you want


## Results
